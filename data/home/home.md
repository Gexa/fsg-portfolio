Ferenc, Gergő and Sándor: three friends who know each other from primary school. Ferenc and Gergő started programming more than 20 years ago. We are professionals for 8-13 years. Our careers took quite different paths, we became experts of different fields. Recently we asked ourselves that why don’t we work together? It would be awesome! We are good old friends, and our skills and experience complement each others very well. So now we are in search of a fitting opportunity.
